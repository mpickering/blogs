_Summary: I've left Standard Chartered and will be starting at Barclays shortly._

I've been working at [Standard Chartered](https://www.sc.com/en/) for almost 8 years, but a few weeks ago I handed in my notice. While at Standard Chartered I got to work with some very smart people, on some very interesting projects. I have learnt a lot about whether Haskell works at large scales (it does!), what mistakes you can make and how to avoid those mistakes. My work at Standard Chartered lead to [the Shake build system](http://shakebuild.com), along with 100's of other projects that alas remain locked in proprietary banking world. I've used our [in-house strict Haskell (Mu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgOzYZDrXL0) to write lots of systems, and cemented my opinion of whether languages should be strict or lazy (lazy!). I've taught many people Haskell, and sold the values of functional programming to everyone I met.

After all that, I've decided to take a job at [Barclays](https://www.home.barclays/) and will be starting mid-August. In this new role I plan to use real [GHC-Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/), all the advanced features that enables (existentials, laziness etc), with [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)/[Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) to leverage all of [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/). My experience of building on top of C/C++ libraries for the last 8 years has made me envious of the amazing quality of Haskell libraries (to a first approximation, they might be a little slower than the C/C++ on average, but they won't leak, are multithread safe, and someone has thought about the corner cases). With any luck, I'll also be able to contribute some more of these libraries back to the community.

Once I officially start at Barclays I'll be hiring a team of London-based Haskell programmers to work with. More details to follow in a few weeks. For now, I will say that for hiring decisions I'm _really_ interested in seeing actual code. If you are interested in a Haskell job anywhere you should probably have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account with some code on it. If you've done any fun projects, hacked around with an encoding of de-Bruijn indicies with type families, or tried to implement a JavaScript parser using only functions from `base` which have at most 1 vowel, shove it up. Having libraries on Hackage is even better. I judge people by their best code, not their worst, so more code is always better.

In case people are curious, here are a few questions I expect to be asked:

* Does this mean Standard Chartered is going to stop using Haskell? No. Standard Chartered has lots of Haskell programmers and will be continuing with Mu (aka the Haskell language, but not the GHC implementation).
* What does this mean for my open source libraries? For most, it means nothing, or they will improve because I might be using them in my day job. I don't think Standard Chartered is the biggest user of any of my libraries anymore. The one exception is [Bake](https://github.com/ndmitchell/bake), which was designed quite specifically to address the needs of Standard Chartered. I may continue to work on it, I may pass maintainership over to someone at Standard Chartered, or I may do nothing further with it. Time will tell, but the source will remain available indefinitely.
