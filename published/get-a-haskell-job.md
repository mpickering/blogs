# How to get a Haskell job

_Summary: There are four things I recommend to get a Haskell job. Applies to most technologies._

I was recently emailed by someone who asked for advice on what they could do to get a Haskell job in the future. Rather than share my reply only with them, I thought I'd cc the world via my blog. I'd give the same advice if asked about how to get a job focusing on any technology, just changing the examples. While the pieces of advice explain how they can be used to get a job, I believe they are all useful in their own right too!

**Write Haskell**

The most important thing to get a job in Haskell, is being fluent in Haskell, which can only be done by writing real Haskell programs/libraries. Solving small exercises or challenges will help a bit, but there are some limitations/solutions/approaches that you only learn when trying to do something for real. For beginners at Haskell, I recommend taking whatever you are interested in outside of Haskell, and writing a library about that. It can be image codecs, statistics, lasers, poker - whatever. There's probably something you know a lot about, which most people don't, which gives you a good starting point. That library will convince future employers you know how to write good code, and in the best case, you'll find an employer ends up using your library. Hiring people whose work you already use is an easy decision. When I've hired programmers in the past, I treat their CV as a pointer to their GitHub account.

**Meet Haskellers**

In most cities there are a bunch of either Haskell of functional programming meetups. Usually [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/functional-programming/) will have them, but a Google search can find them too. If there's nothing near you, try a more global event like [ZuriHac](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2020/) or [Haskell Implementors Workshop](https://wiki.haskell.org/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop). These events give you an idea how other Haskell programmers think, and there are always people who are currently employed to write Haskell, who might offer you a job. Some of these Haskellers will even become friends who you collaborate with over decades.

**Write words**

As you are learning, write down what you are learning, what you are thinking, the hurdles you overcome and the thoughts you have. In many cases, no one will listen, but the mere act of writing down the words serves as a record of what you are learning. In some cases, you'll find an audience, and that audience will give you credibility (which isn't real credibility, but the world is a funny place) and contacts which can be useful in getting you a job. When I started, I wrote on [my blog](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/), but now Twitter or Medium might be better. Maybe it should be Twitch streams or SnapChat messages - I've no idea. Do whatever works for you. When I got my first Haskell job, I had colleagues who didn't know who I was, but had already been reading my blog.

**Read news**

It's important to have a rough idea of what's happening in the Haskell world. For Haskell, you might read [Planet Haskell](https://planet.haskell.org/), some mailing lists, follow some people on Twitter, or read academic papers like thoes at ICFP. Nowadays there is so much information it's impossible to keep on top of it all, and if you try, you'll end up neglecting the other pieces of advice. Reading news won't directly get you a job, but it will expose you to a variety of techniques that keep you learning more.
