# Time as seconds

Everyone should use time as seconds in all their API's. It's ISO standard, has great range of floating point over the desired range, and it's simple. Take a look at thread-delay.

Suggested to me by Lennart.

I also format times as 8m3s, which I've found is the only unambiguous way, see Shake.
