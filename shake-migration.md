If Make could do what you are doing, like Shake can do it, and there
are certainly places Shake is a lot better than Make. When doing a big
Make to Shake migration, I often recommend mirroring exactly what the
Make did first (which gives you a working spec, and also lets you get
familiar with Shake), then secondly taking advantage of Shake to do
better than Make .
