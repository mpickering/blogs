# GitHub enables Collaboration

Not news to everyone, but I'd like to share my experiences. Recently I've spent a lot of time reviewing code, not writing it. I'm thinking of three projects in particular.

* In FilePath, dude did a fantastic job fixing it. Massive patches, thoughtfully discussed, carefully reviewed and fixed. He basically pulled the package into the modern era. Despite taking over the code, other than reviewing the pull requests, I haven't actually looked at the code. That's impressive collaboration, and using GitHub supported it nicely.
* In Shake a few people have drive-by patched it.
* In ghcid, I wrote a fairly rudimentary tool. Because of how easy it is with pull requests, I got a comaintainer.
* I recently spotted the JSON library fails to build on GHC HEAD. Because there is a GitHub repo I was happy to fix it up. Without, I'd be reluctant.

I moved to GitHub mostly to get these pull requests, which people anecdotally said would come. And they have.
