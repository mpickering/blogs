# Selective program taxes

Things you have to do to make the world a better place.

* In GUI, accessibility and tab order.

One of my goals has been to eliminate programming taxes. The worst are those which only affect some people. It's a tax to fix your code so it doesn't segfault, but one you're likely to pay since it's universal. It's a worse tax to fix it to be accessible because it only helps people who use screen readers, which isn't you.

**Example 1: withSocketsDo**

**Example 2: cross-platform FilePath manipulation**

Make it easier than doing it wrongly.

**Example 3: http_proxy**

Best.
